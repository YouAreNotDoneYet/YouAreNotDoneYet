================

No developer can keep all of the available testing methodologies in their head.

This list, a port of (and hopefully expansion on) the list by Michael Hunter, is designed to provide helpful guidance to the community for testing and (hopefully not?) breaking your apps.

This is being done [With Michael's Permission](https://twitter.com/humbugreality/status/507584012039094272). I'm just a fan. :)

I am hoping that these original ideas and pull requests from the community will help turn these sorts of guidelines into a living, breathing organism -- a probiotic for your code.
